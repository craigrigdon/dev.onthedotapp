Craig Rigdon

On The Dot was born out of necessity. Busy dad of four, Craig, was struggling to manage multiple drop offs and pickups for his active family. Taking cues via text from his multitasking wife seemed to be the only way to mange their busy household. A typical Saturday included dropping one child off a birthday party, running another to a sporting event, a play date, a rehearsal, balancing social commitments, nap schedules, grocery shopping and trips to the hardware store. 

Having just moved to a new city, Craig was constantly using his Maps app, trying to see how long it would take to get to each location and manually calculating travel time between destinations (all while taking into consideration how long it took to strap in his wiggly, non cooperative toddler into her car seat).  Between his family’s calendar of events, his growing "Daddy Do" list and navigating a new neighbourhood, he knew there had to be a better way to stay organized and on time.

Craig couldn’t find an app that would notify him in real time, based on his current location, how much time he had to make it to his next scheduled commitment; so he decided to build one himself.  Originally designed for his busy family, Craig soon discovered that his app would be helpful for everyone; whether you were juggling four kids going to dance lessons and kindergarten orientation or managing a busy household of one. On The Dot App is an essential tool to help us all juggle the chaos of life and stay organized and on time.
